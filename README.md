### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 My name is Anna Phommasone and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Monash University.

🔭 I’m working on a website that visualises a user's Spotify history data.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.

❤️ I'm interested in full-stack development.

⚡ Fun fact: I was part of a j-pop flash mob dance once!
