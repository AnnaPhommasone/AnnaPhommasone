### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 My name is Anna Phommasone and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Monash University.

🔭 I’m working on a website that visualises a user's Spotify history data.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.

❤️ I'm interested in all domains of technology, including but not limited to: full-stack development, mobile app development, and web development.

⚡ Fun fact: I was part of a j-pop flash mob dance once!
